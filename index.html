  <h3> Datasets </h3>
  <p> For this course I will focus on analyzing New York City's Street Tree Census data from 1995, 2005 and 2015. This project will require some data processing and linking of stree tree and socioeconomic datasets from different time periods.</p>



  <h3> Analysis Question</h3>
  <p> I am particularly interested in how changes in the street tree population from 1995 to 2005, and 2005 to 2015, may be similar or different for New York City neighborhoods, and whether the levels of those changes are correlated to socioeconomic factors. I suspect that neighborhoods that have seen declines in street tree numbers from 1995 to 2005, would have seen increases in tree numbers from 2005 to 2015 due to large scale planting programs that were launched in NYC in 2007.
  </p>

  <p> Related to this, I expect that patterns in street tree populations in 1995 are related to socioeconomics, of the different neighborhoods, in particular housing value and income, and that those relationships would be weaker in 2005 vs 2015, as NYC planting programs specifically focused on improving street trees in traditionally underserved neighborhoods. </p>

  



  <h3> Literature Review </h3>
  <p> It is generally understood in the literature that the distribution of urban ecological amenities are strongly related to wealth, in cities across the US.  My project will seek to establish the extent to which this has been and continues to be true in New York City.  </p>
